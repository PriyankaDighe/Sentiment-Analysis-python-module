  The place is as eccentric as it's name. Quirky architecture, mellow vibe and really good food that does not shy away from healthy proportions. Would recommend for a laid back afternoon to cozy up with a book, catch up with your lot or perhaps even for a meet cute with a date.

  Average place offering below average food.

We were a group of 7 with a few kids to add to the chaos in the already packed restaurant. Since this was an after dinner meet, we could not order too many things on the menu.

But we did order a few things, and oh, how much we had to repent for it. We ordered mac n cheese, barbecued mushroom pizza and ratatouille. The mac n cheese was the worst we could have ever had, with the taste of uncooked flour apparent to everyone who tried it. It also had sweet corn! Rubbish. We returned it and got the same dish with a few modifications. I would really think they would have made us a fresh dish, but there was nothing we could do about it. The ratatouille was average and hardly had anything to appreciate. The pizza was alright.

We also ordered a ton of shakes, salted caramel, hazelnut frappe, cold coffee, Oreo shake and what not. All the shakes were decent, and I specially liked my salted caramel shake. Dessert was a massive... read more

  One of the very few places in koregaon park serve good pasta.
The concept is unique.
You can really have alcohol at very cheap rate here. Really loved the concept.
Pasta both white and red are really delicious.

  If you had to choose between losing weight and Chocolate....
Would you like it dark,white or with milk ? üç´
..
This heavenly exquisite Frozon Hot Chocolate had me...!
Honey Chilli Fries and Cheese Chilli Fries ; These are the Best fries i had till date. It had perfect balance of honey and chilli. Which made it taste perfect. And Cheese chilli fries were yum üòã Must Try
Liked where place is centrally located so that one can drop by while crossing the Koregaon Park. The only issue is parking which is difficult to hunt. The ambiance and music üé∂is Old school. Special treat for vegetarians as they serve only "VEG". Their food 5/5. The one in pic is "Classic Margarita Pizza". Thin crust with tomatos , chilli sauce and cheese and topped with basil just like other pizza.
"Pink Sauce Pasta" last but not least my favourite. Pasta was damn tasty. The taste of sauce was so perfectly blended and mouth watering.
PS : Due to weak light... read more

  A good place to spend your evening with good food. I ordered a pasta Alfredo which was tasty lots of veggies. Also ordered a Tex-Mex Rice which was decent enough in taste. Only problem was the price against the quantity which I felt did not go well but overall its a good place to hang out. Would recommend to have a good pasta in Koregaon Park.

  Nice place to hangout! Tried the nachos, cheese garlic bread and speedy spaghetti and must say all the dishes were very good.
However the main highlight was the blueberry cheesecake. It was one of the best cheesecakes I've ever eaten!! It was light, fresh and had just the right amount of sweetness.

A must try in Koregaon Park!

  When you have shopped a lot and want something awesome to end your day with, Saut√©ed stories is the place you should visit. We weren't extremely hungry so, we ordered a Veg lasagne, watermelon cooler and a frappuccino.
The ambience was just perfect with tasty food and mocktails. Loved it and would definitely visit again.

  Budget:1000rs for two
Food:for starters -Honey chilli fries : they where very saucy ,perfect sweet,sour and spicy,loved it .
Burger - Jalpenos potato burger : potato patty with some jalpenos and lots of red sauce , very tasty.
Pizza -Classic cheese pizza:A thin crust with tomato chili sauce and chesse topped with some basil,just like some other pizza .
Dessert : Dark chocolate mouse : A cup of dark choclate topped with some almonds and strwaberry jelly , just perfect .
Ambience : the place is a bit small than expected.Good music was on all the time .The staff was quite polite.Eventhough It was on main street it was bit difficult to find because it had no board.They need to work on their ambience a bit.
Overall a very awesome place.
A must visit if u r looking for something in KP.
Also they gave us a complementary dessert it was a basket with a layer of caramel and chocolate ,one of the tastiest things i had here,i dont remember the name of it though.

  A small hangout place with some flashy out of the box decor which may suit better for the night times..!
Definitely not a dining place but a perfect place to seduce the taste buds of Pure vegeterian as the place serves only veg..
long VEGGIE menu with lots of variety but the only thing that let us down were the flies they were too troublesome..
Jalapeno dynamites was smthng worth tasting and even the exotica veg pizza was crunchy with thin crust..chili fries taste didnt meet the expectatns..!
But all in all experience was good would be visiting again to look out for the evng lights..!
